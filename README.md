# Latent Factor Model Based Recommendation Systems

This repository consists of latent factor based models popularly used in collaborative filtering based recommendation systems. This includes Funk Matrix Factorization, SVD++, Asymmetric SVD among classical methods and Neural Collaborative Filtering among deep learning methods. Further this repository also contains code for Fast Influence Analysis which can generate explanations for the recommendations. This work was done as part of the course DS 226: Introduction to Computing for Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning at Indian Institute of Science.
